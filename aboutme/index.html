<div class="info">
<p>In the meantime I am making the most of any spare time writing, anything and everything! Alongside my university course and my passion for writing my creative love extends much further...
</P>
<P>I really enjoy sewing and making my own creations so recently to complement my studies I have set up my own small business on Etsy, InspiredByDotty. The shop is named after my great nanny Dot who in her days loved spending her time sewing, cross stitching, knitting and much more. I love nothing more than using the skills passed down to me to make products that put a smile on peoples faces.

<div class="animalinfo">
<p> Alongside my creativity, I have a love for animals great and small. At home I have two guinea pigs, a slightly mad dog and a house rabbit. I love nothing more than snuggling up with my pets in the evening to relax.
